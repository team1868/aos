// The LogReader classes takes in a set of files which constitute a log and
// replays the messages in those logs into an EventLoop.
//
// Typically, the log writer will be configured in a way that produces multiple
// .bfbs files which, taken together, constitute a single log. A single log will
// generally be organized into a folder which contains all the data for that
// log. However, it is not required that this be the case. The LogReader can
// process any set of files which, when taken together:
//
// * Do not contain gaps in data (e.g., if using log rotation via
//   Logger::Rotate, any set of logs adjacent in time may be played together;
//   however, if you were to rotate logs by shutting down and restarting the
//   entire logger process you would likely end up missing data on some channels
//   and be unable to replay).
// * Use the same AOS configuration.
// * Form a fully-connected graph of node boots. For instance, given a 2-node
//   system with nodes A and B where each node has a logger and where the
//   following sequence occurs:
//
//   Time | Node A    | Node B    | Notes
//   0    | boot 1    | boot 1    | Both loggers running
//   1    | rebooting | boot 1    |
//   2    | boot 2    | boot 1    | Both nodes have loggers running again.
//   3    | boot 2    | rebooting |
//   4    | boot 2    | boot 2    | Both nodes have loggers runnign again.
//
//   We will have logs from the first and second time each node was booted.
//
//   * If you have the node A-boot 1 log from boot 1 and the node B-boot 2 log,
//     you will not be able to replay them in the same logger because the logger
//     will have no way of determining when events from the node B-boot 2 log
//     should be replayed.
//   * If you have all four logs (node A-boot 1, node A-boot 2, node B-boot 1,
//     nodeB-boot2), the log reader will be able to replay the logs all
//     together.
//   * If you have just the node B-boot1 and node A-boot 2 logs then the log
//     reader will be able to replay any events that are present in those two
//     logs, because they do overlap with one another.
//
//   Note that this does assume an AOS configuration where node A and node B
//   do talk to one another. It is technically possible to have multinode AOS
//   configurations where the separate nodes do not actually communicate, or
//   do not log any information about their communnication; this is generally
//   strongly discouraged, but is possible.
//
// In order to pass these logs to the LogReader, you will typically end up using
// a pattern like:
// LogReader reader(aos::logger::SortParts(aos::logger::FindLogs(folder)));
// This is because the LogReader expects a list of specific files, grouped by
// node boots, to look at. However, in most cases the user will be specifying a
// set of directories.
//
// When you go to actually replay the log, the LogReader will replay all the
// messages in the log as accurately as feasible, including:
// * Having each message be sent in simulation at the time that it was sent on
//   the live system.
// * Providing callbacks for when the logger logically "started" and "ended."
// * Ensuring that every message between the start and end times is replayed.
// * Ensuring that the most recent message from every channel before the start
//   time is available.
// * Delaying messages forwarded across nodes by the same amount of time that
//   they were delayed in the original system (this is done by having the logger
//   store receive timestamps for each forwarded message).
// * Dropping messages that were dropped when forwarded across the network.
// * Estimating the offsets between clocks on different devices in order to
//   generate a reasonable ordering of global events, while guaranteeing that
//   causality is respected (i.e., we won't have a forwarded message appear on a
//   receive node earlier than it was sent on the send node). Note that
//   attempting to satisfy this goal is one of the more common reasons that
//   people encounter "unreadable" logs which the LogReader struggles to handle
//   correctly.
// * Setting the boot UUIDs on the simulated event loops to match the original
//   boot UUIDS.
// * Rebooting simulated nodes when nodes rebooted in the logfiles.
//
// As a note on data integrity: We generally aim to ensure that users of the
// log reading code be made aware when data is missing; e.g., if a
// corrupted log has caused for some number of messages to be missing in the
// middle of the log. However, we only provide these guarantees between the
// start and end time of the log for any given node boot. Because of how the log
// writers work, we sometimes have indeterminate amounts of data before and
// after the time bounded by the start/end time (while we do guarantee the
// presence of the most recent message from every channel before the start time,
// there may be more than one pre-start time message on some channels).
// Additionally:
// * Any channel marked NOT_LOGGED in the configuration is known not to
//   have been logged and thus will be silently absent in log replay.
// * If an incomplete set of log files is provided to the reader (e.g.,
//   only logs logged on a single node on a multi-node system), then
//   any *individual* channel as observed on a given node will be
//   consistent, but similarly to a NOT_LOGGED channel, some data may
//   not be available.
// * At the end of a log, data for some channels/nodes may end before
//   others; during this time period, you may observe silently dropped
//   messages. This will be most obvious on uncleanly terminated logs or
//   when merging logfiles across nodes (as the logs on different nodes
//   will not finish at identical times).
//
// As the log replays, there are several things that you can register callbacks
// for at different stages. The common callbacks users may register are:
// * NodeEventLoopFactory::OnStartup(): Occurs at time t=0 for each node boot.
// * LogReader::OnStart(): Occurs at the log start time for each node boot.
// * EventLoop::OnRun(): Called when the event loop begins running for each
//   event loop.
// * LogReader::OnEnd(): Occurs at the log end time for each node boot.
// * NodeEventLoopFactory::OnShutdown(): Occurs when each node stops executing
//   events entirely.
// Note that EventLoops may be created during any of the LogReader or
// NodeEventLoopFactory start/end callbacks; the OnRun callbacks for any given
// EventLoop will be executed immediately after the
// LogReader/NodeEventLoopFactory callbacks finish.
//
// The NodeEventLoopFactory callbacks are present in any simulated event loop
// execution; the reason that they are separate from the LogReader callbacks is
// that logs will typically contain data outside of the strict start/end times
// of the log. It is just that outside of the start/end time interval it may be
// the case that not all channels have messages available. As such, you will
// typically use the NodeEventLoopFactory-based methods when you want to
// register applications that will process _all_ the data available in the log,
// but that the LogReader callbacks are preferred in the vast majority of cases,
// where you want to be able to trust that all channels will have data
// available while your applications are running.
//
// This corresponds to the following tyipcal sequence of events:
// 1. LogReader is constructed.
// 2. User calls LogReader::RegisterWithoutStarting()
// 3. User calls SimulatedEventLoopFactory::Run(). While this is executing:
//    a. NodeEventLoopFactory::OnStartup() methods are called immediately.
//    b. Any pre-"start time" messaegs from the logger are replayed
//    c. LogReader::OnStart() methods are called as each node reaches its start
//       time.
//    d. Every logged channel is expected to have every message available.
//    e. LogReader::OnEnd() methods are called as each node reaches the end time
//       for its logger.
//    f. NodeEventLoopFactory::OnShutdown() methods are called whenever a node
//       reboots; that node then gets started back up with the OnStartup() calls
//       and will go back to step (a).
//    g. When every logged message is replayed, all
//       NodeEventLoopFactory::OnShutdown() callbacks that have not yet been
//       called will be called and Run() will return.
//
// It is strongly encourage that any application creation during log replay use
// the NodeEventLoopFactory AlwaysStart() or MaybeStart() methods called from
// the LogReader::OnStart() method, and that you only deviate from that pattern
// when you have a specific reason to do so.

// Replays all the channels in the logfile to the event loop.
